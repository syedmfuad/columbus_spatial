# spatial_miscellaneous
Started with the goal of developing an undergrad geoinformatics/spatial data science summer course and ended up as a reference repository for spatial mapping and raster data manipulation and processing. 

## treecover.R 
Merging household-level demographics with neighborhood amenity raster files (heterogenous grid-cell resolutions), for e.g., tree canopy, land use, open space, distance to nearest water body, etc. 

## map.R 
Trying out different mappings with using Google API 

## soil quality.R 
Trying out different raster files of soil quality, precipitation, temperature, agricultural production, yield, harvested area. 

## spatial columbus.R
Trying out spatial regression models using Elhorst (2010) model sequence. 

## columbus_2.R 
Fully Endogenized Finite Mixture Modeling with Columbus housing data for two submarkets + mapping of submarkets 

## columbus_3.R 
Fully Endogenized Finite Mixture Modeling with Columbus housing data for three submarkets in Columbus, OH 

## columbus_4.R 
Fully Endogenized Finite Mixture Modeling with Columbus housing data for four submarkets in Columbus, OH
